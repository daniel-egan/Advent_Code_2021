Have a list with all the different columns and rows
Have a counter or a list or something which has how many within the row/column have been found
Have a checker to see if there is a counter / row with 5 found variables
Use while loop to run through while 'oneComplete' is false 
Have one complete turned to true if one of the values have 5, this will brteak out the for loop and tell you which column/row will win first
